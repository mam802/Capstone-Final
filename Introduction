Introduction/Business Problem - Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the 
Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant 
to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would 
care about your problem.


The problem I would like to solve is helping a client decide where to open their first restaurant. For this business to be successful,
the client needs to choose an area in the city of New York that is very lively and surrounded by other businesses that would attract people.
A restaurant's intial two years are the most important because it needs to make back all the money that was initially invested in it to
make profits. Therefore, the location is essential to making it work.
