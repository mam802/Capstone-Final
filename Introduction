Introduction/Business Problem - Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the 
Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant 
to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would 
care about your problem.


The problem I would like to solve is helping a client decide where to buy their first home. This particular client is still young, but is
married. The couple is looking for a home that is in a safe enough area to start raising a family, but also lively enough for them
to not feel retired yet. This perfect area needs to have businesses, restaurants, and exciting venues, with a balance of parks.
A perfect home is hard to find, but hopefully using clusters, this couple will get the right home for them.
