## Introduction/Business Problem
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

***The problem at hand is deciding which neighborhood in Toronto would be best fit for a couple to purchase a new home. The setting is extremely important, since the couple is young and has no kids yet. The place needs to be lively enough, so there are fun activities to do around them; however, there also cannot be too much commotion in the event that they do start a family there. Therefore, the place to open needs to have a good balance of these two elements.***

## Data acquisition and cleaning 
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

***The data to be used will be from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and will be paired with Foursquare data after. The data will ultimately categorized by neighborhood with different charactersitics like "Top Venues" to determine what the best spot is to open the restaurant.***

## Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.

***To make the decision, I used a combination of the clusters formed on the map to see how things spacially panned out. I also used tables that included information on what each neighborhood and cluster had to offer.***

## Results
Results section where you discuss the results.

***There were two big clusters (1 & 3) that had a generous amount of neighborhoods and activities inside.***

## Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.

***After looking at the results, I think that if I were to redo this activity, I could also take into account various datasets in income and crime in each area too. This would definitely account more for the aspect of my client that might start a family.***

### Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

***This report could be helpful for anyone planning to purchase a home in Toronto. While they may not have the same needs as my original client, they can still observe each cluster, and within each cluster, each neighborhood, to see what there was to offer.***
