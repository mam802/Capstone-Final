Data - Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the 
Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the 
Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you 
will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.


The data I will use is from http://www.ciclt.net/sn/clt/capitolimpact/gw_ziplist.aspx?FIPS=42003
It includes all neighborhoods in Allegheny County, along with their zipcodes.
